## Architecture Overview

This is a React 18 + TypeScript + Vite application for pottery management called "Potterly".

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4.x
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v6 (using BrowserRouter)
- **State Management**: Nanostores with React integration
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (serverless)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: CSS modules with BEM-like naming convention and global CSS systems
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
- **UUID Generation**: uuid library for unique identifiers

### Project Structure
- `src/main.tsx` - Application entry point with React Router setup and global styles import
- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component with route definitions and sidebar layout
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components (Sidebar, PotteryCard, KanbanBoard, ProfilePicture)
- `src/pages/` - Route-specific page components (Home, Pieces, Profile, CreatePiece)
- `src/pages/developer/` - Developer/admin pages not shown in sidebar navigation
- `src/stores/` - Nanostores state management (pieces and user stores with CRUD actions)
- `src/network/` - API layer for database communication (pieces.ts, users.ts)
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions (PotteryPiece, User interfaces)
- `src/styles/` - Global CSS modules (button, badge, form, and card systems)
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions (profile-picture.ts for Google SSO image handling, storage.ts for localStorage persistence)
- `src/variables.css` - Global CSS variables for pottery color design system
- `netlify/functions/` - Serverless API endpoints for database operations
- `db/schema.ts` - Drizzle ORM database schema definitions
- `examples/` - Sample JSON data (dogfood.json, user.json)
- `.env` - Environment variables (DATABASE_URL)
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration for functions, dev server, and SPA routing
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle ORM configuration
- CSS files are co-located with their respective components

### Key Patterns
- **Routing**: Uses declarative routing with Routes/Route components in App.tsx
- **State Management**: Nanostores atoms with reactive React hooks (useStore)
- **Network Layer**: Dedicated API functions in `src/network/` for all HTTP communication
- **Navigation**: Sidebar component uses NavLink with active state styling
- **Styling**: BEM-style CSS class naming (e.g., `sidebar__title`, `sidebar__link--active`)
- **Component Structure**: Functional components with TypeScript, default exports
- **Layout**: Fixed sidebar + main content area layout pattern
- **Data Flow**: Store â†’ Component via useStore hook for reactive updates
- **API Architecture**: Separation of concerns between state management and network calls

### Component Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture with centralized state:

**Core Components:**
- **Sidebar**: Navigation with animated icons and pottery-themed styling, mobile hamburger menu
- **PotteryCard**: Reusable card component displaying pottery piece details with status tracking, archive status, and starred indicators
- **KanbanBoard**: Stage-based workflow visualization using PotteryCard components
- **Filters**: Advanced filtering by stage, type, priority, search, archived status, and starred pieces
- **HamburgerMenu**: Mobile navigation toggle with animated hamburger icon
- **ProfilePicture**: Reusable component for Google SSO profile pictures with flexible sizing, fallback to pottery emoji, and responsive design

**Pages:**
- **Home**: Dashboard with live statistics from piece store, time-based greetings, and navigation buttons to main app sections
- **Profile**: Basic page component
- **Pieces**: Tabbed interface with nested routing (Kanban/Table views)
- **PieceDetail**: Individual piece detail page with comprehensive view/edit mode for all piece data and stage-specific information
- **CreatePiece**: Form for adding new pottery pieces with status tracking, redirects to detail page after creation
- **Developer pages**: Isolated in `src/pages/developer/` (not in sidebar navigation)

**State Management:**
- **Pieces Store**: Centralized pottery piece management with reactive filtering and database persistence
  - Hybrid data approach: memory store for performance, database for persistence
  - CRUD operations: addPiece, updatePiece, removePiece, archivePiece, starPiece (with database sync)
  - Advanced filtering: stage, type, priority, search, archived status, starred pieces
  - Computed filteredPiecesStore for reactive UI updates
  - `getPieceById` function with fallback to database when not in memory store
- **User Store**: User authentication and profile management with persistent sessions
  - User state management with authentication status, loading, and error states
  - Actions: createUser, loginUser, getUserProfile, updateUserProfile, logoutUser
  - Helper functions: getCurrentUser, isUserAuthenticated, getCurrentUserId
  - Integration with pieces store for ownership tracking
  - Persistent login state using localStorage with 30-day session expiry
  - Automatic session restoration on app startup with data validation
  - Seamless user experience across browser sessions and page refreshes

### Routes
**Main Application Routes:**
- `/` - Home dashboard with live statistics and quick navigation (backwards compatibility)
- `/home` - Home dashboard (canonical path)
- `/pieces` - Pottery pieces with nested routing:
  - `/pieces/kanban` - Kanban board view (default)
  - `/pieces/table` - Table view
- `/piece/:id` - Individual piece detail page with view/edit mode toggle
- `/profile` - Current user's profile page with edit capabilities
- `/profile/:username` - View other user profiles by username (read-only, public view)
- `/create-piece` - Form to create new pottery pieces with stage query parameter support

**Developer/Admin Routes:**
- `/developer` - Color palette design guide showcasing pottery-themed colors
- `/design` - Kanban board interface for pottery studio workflow management  
- `/table-design` - Table view design showcase
- **Access**: These pages are accessible by direct URL but not shown in sidebar navigation
